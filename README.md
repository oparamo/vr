# Virtual Reality ðŸš€

I've been wanting to explore virtual reality concepts for a while, and I'm putting anything I make here. My plan is to keep this repo as dumb as possible; the only fancy framework I plan to use for now is [A-Frame](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/).

Check out a [live demo](https://oparamo.github.io/vr/) of my code ðŸ™ˆ.

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and follow these steps to get started locally:
1. open a terminal
2. `cd` to this project's directory
3. run `npm i`
4. run `npm start`
5. go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser
