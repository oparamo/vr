# Virtual Reality ðŸš€

I've been wanting to explore virtual reality concepts for a while, and I'm putting anything I make here. My plan is to keep this repo as dumb as possible; the only fancy framework I plan to use for now is [A-Frame](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/).

I've enabled GitHub pages for this repo, [check it out](https://oparamo.github.io/vr/) ðŸ™ˆ.
